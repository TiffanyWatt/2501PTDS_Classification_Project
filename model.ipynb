    "### **Imports**\n",
    "- **pandas**, **numpy** — data manipulation and numerical operations.  \n",
    "- **re** — regular expressions for cleaning text.  \n",
    "- **nltk** — natural language toolkit for tokenization, stopwords, and lemmatization.  \n",
    "- **scikit-learn** modules:\n",
    "  - `TfidfVectorizer`, `CountVectorizer` — convert text into numerical vectors.\n",
    "  - `train_test_split` — split data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "  - `LogisticRegression` — build the baseline classification model.\n",
    "  - `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`, `f1_score` — evaluate model performance.\n",
    "  - `LabelEncoder` — convert text labels into numeric form.\n",

    "## 🧼 Refined Text Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This function standardizes and cleans each news article before it’s fed into the model.  \n",
    "It expands on the model version by adding contraction handling, smarter regex cleanup, and improved token filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why These Steps Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removes noise** such as URLs, hashtags, and symbols that don’t add meaning.  \n",
    "- **Handles contractions** (“don’t” → “do not”) to retain grammatical intent.  \n",
    "- **Keeps digits** since numbers can be meaningful in financial or tech news.  \n",
    "- **Preserves negations** like “not_good” to help the model understand sentiment and tone.  \n",
    "- **Lemmatizes tokens** to reduce variations of the same word (e.g., “runs”, “running” → “run”).  \n",
    "- **Filters stopwords and normalizes spaces** for a cleaner, standardized text dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Why This Is an Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to earlier preprocessing versions, this refined approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expands contractions**, improving text clarity and readability.  \n",
    "- **Retains numerals** that often carry value in business, tech, and quantitative news.  \n",
    "- **Uses compiled regex patterns** for faster, more efficient text cleaning.  \n",
    "- **Produces more consistent and lower-noise text**, giving the TF-IDF vectorizer higher-quality input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this version ensures the model learns from **meaningful, normalized language patterns**, which enhances both **accuracy** and **generalization**."
